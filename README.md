# Charging Networks
Exploring the ever changing world of public fast charging stations!

As of 2023-07-29 01:30:29 the United States and Canada have installed 36,854 fast charging stations.1 As the name suggests, fast chargers are the only practical way to fill-up on longer trips, so understanding them is important to decarbonize travel beyond your daily commute. About 95 percent of fast chargers do not accept credit, debit or cash, relying instead on charging networks.

Tesla is a dominant network in this space, and currently exclusive to Tesla vehicles. With that said, some major auto manufacturers have begun signing deals to gain access to this rebust network. Ford, one such company, is anticipated to release a NACS - CCS adaptor imminently in 2024.
